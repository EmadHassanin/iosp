## Slide with columns as boxes

Just a proof of concept. I changed the original lua file from `ioslides_presentation`.

### Box 1{.col-4 .box .bg-red}

Test 1

### Box 2{.col-6 .box .bg-green}

- line 1
- line 2

### Box 3{.col-6 .box .bg-blue}

This box has again a width of 6 col: it will be rendered in a new row

### {.col-12}

We are able to exit the box using an empty `###` header and setting a 12 col wide row.

## second slide

Trying to use `---` to exit a column as suggested [here](https://github.com/koncina/iosp/issues/5).

### Box{.col-6 .box .bg-blue}

Now we are inside the box

---

Now we are outside the box in a new line

---

Now we created a new slide
